# Set the CORS headers on every request.
# We do this on every request as there is no harm.
# In addition, we do this in the Apache layer rather than in Tomcat,
# because the Grails "cors" plugin only sets the CORS headers if the ORIGIN header is sent.
# The issue is because keframes.css is requested per the index.gsp and it's also requested via AJAX by the Skrollr js.
# CloudFront caches the first request, and since the first request comes in without the ORIGIN header,
# the CORS headers aren't set.
# The AJAX call (the second call) fails because the CORS headers aren't set.
